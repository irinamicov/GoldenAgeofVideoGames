# When Was the Golden Age of Video Games?

## Context

Video games are big business: the global gaming market is projected to be worth more than $300 billion by 2027, according to [Mordor Intelligence ](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/global-gaming-market). With so much money at stake, the major game publishers are hugely incentivized to create the next big hit. But are games getting better, or has the golden age of video games already passed?

## Project Description

In this project, I analyze video game critic and user scores as well as sales data for the top 400 video games released since 1977. I search for a golden age of video games by identifying release years that users and critics liked best, and I explore the business side of gaming by looking at game sales data.

In the process of exploring and analyzing the data, I use skills such as joining datasets, comparing results with set theory, filtering, grouping, ordering data and using subqueries.

### Some of the questions answered in this project:

- What are some of the top-selling video games of all time!?
- In what years of video gaming history have the critics given the highest average score?
- What years have the video game players loved the most?
- How many copies of games were sold in the most successful years in gaming history (according to both critics and players)?

This project uses a portion of the [Video Game Sales Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/holmjason2/videogamedata). Here, the data is available in two tables, each limited to 400 rows.

### Project Tasks:

1. The ten best-selling video games
2. Missing review scores
3. Years that video game critics loved
4. Was 1982 really that great?
5. Years that dropped off the critics' favourites list
6. Years video game players loved
7. Years that both players and critics loved
8. Sales in the best video game years
